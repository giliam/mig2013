A web-app written for the MIG SE team and its project of isolated word
recognition.

It is made of an HTML/JS interface using getUserMedia API and MediaRecorder API,
which records the user's word, send them to our server, and responds by the
word recognized, if it's been.

Because of the unstable state of MediaRecorder API, the app is currently (as of
28/11/13) only supported by the latest version of Mozilla Firefox.
